# Pencil Durability Kata
I settled on this particular [Kata](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability) because, of all the available options, it struck me as the most engaging.  There are several unique cases to check, and it provides a wide range of small logical hurdles to clear, building upon each as you move forward with the application.  I feel this challenge allowed me to display the widest range of development skill I have.

## Setup
To begin, after cloning down this repository, you'll want to run the following commands to properly view this Kata.

**npm install**
This will install all required dependencies for this application:\
    *Jest* [For Running Tests]\
    *Run-Func* [For Running Main Function]\
    *Colors* [For Console Statement Readability]

**npm run kata**
This will run the main Kata function, which includes cascading console statements that log the progress at each stage.

**npm run test**
This will run the Jest Test Suite, which tests 30 use cases of the various kata functions, as well as a Test Kata function, which mimics the main Kata function, with the console statements removed for readability.
